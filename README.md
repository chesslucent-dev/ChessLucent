## üìñ The Origin Story

It all started when I looked up the price of premium chess software and my wallet spontaneously combusted. In that moment of financial despair and chess-induced frustration, a dream was born: **ChessLucent**.

This project is a solemn vow to create the ultimate, all-in-one chess improvement tool that is **100% free and open-source, forever.**

---

## ‚ú® A Feature Set So Advanced, It's Invisible ‚ú®

You might be wondering what groundbreaking features ChessLucent currently offers. Prepare to be amazed. After countless hours of intense thought, I've engineered a piece of software that can do what no other program on the market can:

*   **Currently, ChessLucent can do absolutely nothing.**

It's a blank canvas of pure potential. A minimalist masterpiece. It cannot be broken, it has zero bugs, and it runs with infinite speed on any hardware. Beat that, proprietary software!

## üó∫Ô∏è The Grand (and Possibly Delusional) Roadmap

The plan is to combine the power of every chess tool into one glorious application. The goal is to conquer every operating system known to man: **Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS,** and probably your smart fridge too. Did I say that before? I might be having dementia.

Here's just a taste of what's on the dream board:

- [ ] A beautiful UI that doesn't look like it was designed in 1998.
- [ ] A puzzle generator that creates positions *from your own worst games* so you can relive your trauma.
- [ ] An opening trainer that verbally berates you when you forget your lines.
- [ ] A deep, philosophical AI that questions your life choices after you hang a piece on move 6.
- [ ] Basically, **all chess improvement software combined!**

## üò≠ A Desperate, Humble, and Utterly Serious Plea for Help

I am the project lead. The visionary. The solo dev. There's just one tiny problem:

**I don't actually know how to code.**

I am just a person **FUELED BY PURE, UNFILTERED CHESS PASSION!** My ambition has massively outpaced my skillset, and this glorious vision is currently trapped inside my head.

This is where YOU come in. **ANYONE, ANY HELP WILL BE APPRECIATED!**

*   **Are you a developer?** Please, I beg you. I've heard good things about Rust and Flutter.
*   **Are you a UI/UX designer?** My design skills involve drawing squares in MS Paint. You are desperately needed.
*   **Are you good at organizing things?** You could be the project manager this beautiful mess needs!
*   **Do you just want to offer moral support?** Join the cause!

This is a passion project. There is no payment, because I can't even afford to host a website. Your reward will be eternal glory and the gratitude of chess players everywhere.

## üõ†Ô∏è The Blueprint for Genius (Please Steal This)

When someone who knows what they're doing shows up, here is the proposed stack. It's ambitious, modern, and probably a nightmare to implement, which makes it perfect.

*   **Core Logic:** **Rust**. For performance, safety, and because it sounds cool.
    *   *Package Manager:* `cargo`
*   **Cross-Platform UI:** **Flutter (Dart)**. To get us on every device imaginable.
    *   *Package Manager:* `flutter pub`
*   **Integration:** We'll use **Dart FFI** to call the speedy Rust code from the pretty Flutter UI.

## üöÄ Getting Started (For Time Travelers)

Since the code is currently in a quantum state of non-existence, the setup process is a bit unconventional.

1.  Invent a time machine.
2.  Travel to the future where ChessLucent is a finished, glorious application.
3.  Clone the repository from that timeline:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/chesslucent-dev/ChessLucent.git
    ```
4.  Follow the future `README.md`'s instructions. They're probably great.

## üìú License

This project is and always will be licensed under the **AGPL 3.0 License**.

This basically means it's "aggressively" open-source. Anyone can use, distribute, and modify the code. However, if you modify it and run it on a server to provide a service, you MUST also make your modified source code available. We're keeping chess improvement free for everyone, no exceptions!
